190610904,"Animal Collective: Painting With 12""","<p>Painting With is the eleventh full length Animal Collective album. It was recorded in 2015 at EastWest Studios in Hollywood, California and mixed at Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France with Sonny DiPerri. For fifteen years Animal Collective has been rewriting the musical map, their line-up and aesthetic shifting with each astonishing release as they continue their pursuit of a new psychedelia. The result: Painting With. Warm and personal, dizzying and high definition, concerned with art and the human experience, and the meeting of both - creating something elemental, joyous, and unmistakably Animal Collective. There are three different album covers for Paining With, one for each member in the band - Avey Tare, Geologist, and Panda Bear.</p>",Domino Records,,"new 12""","10s, electronic, indie, spo-default, spo-disabled",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'190610904,272.155422,shopify,deny,manual,20.00,,true,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/1876872d6f100ed8ecf7e6329c6302a267d4d6c3.jpg?v=1585667983,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,true,,,true,,,true,,,true,,,active
yes-tormato-12-picture-disc,"Car Seat Headrest: Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror) 12""","<p>Will Toledo always knew he would return to Twin Fantasy. He never did complete the work. Not really. Never could square his grand ambitions against his mechanical limitations. Listen to his first attempt, recorded at nineteen on a cheap laptop, and you'll hear what Brian Eno fondly calls ""the sound of failure"" - thrilling, extraordinary, and singularly compelling failure. Will's first love, rendered in the vivid teenage viscera of stolen gin, bruised shins, and weird sex, was an event too momentous for the medium assigned to record it.</p>
<p>On the heels of the smashing success of Teens of Denial, Car Seat Headrest will release a new version of Twin Fantasy on Matador Records. ""It was never a finished work,"" Will says, ""and it wasn't until last year that I figured out how to finish it."" He has, now, the benefit of a bigger budget, a full band in fine form, and endless time to tinker. According to him, it took eight months of mixing just to get the drums right. But this is no shallow second take, sanitized in studio and scrubbed of feeling. This is the album he always wanted to make. It sounds the way he always wanted it to sound.</p>
<p>It's been hard, stepping into the shoes of his teenage self, walking back to painful places. There are lyrics he wouldn't write again, an especially sad song he regards as an albatross. But even as he carries the weight of that younger, wounded Will, he moves forward. He grows. He revises, gently, the songs we love so much. In the album's final moments, in those apologies to future me's and you's, there is more forgiveness than fury. This, Will says, is the most vital difference between the old and the new: he no longer sees his own story as a tragedy.</p>",Matador Records,,"new 12""","10s, indie, spo-default, spo-disabled",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'180421245,566.9904625,shopify,deny,manual,34.00,,true,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/db05cc1b3dc7acaf592788b5a7c454aea4095253.jpg?v=1585667839,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,true,,,true,,,true,,,true,,,active
brighteyesimwideawakeitsmorning,"Bright Eyes: I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning","<p>Containing what are undeniably some of his finest songs to date, Bright Eyes two 2005 albums I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn provided unequivocal proof that Conor Oberst belonged to the lineage of great American songwriters. These albums are a soundly articulated slice of modern American life rolled into two very different records. The songs are bursting with all of the rough edges and heartfelt poetry for which Bright Eyes records have earned their acclaim, while exposing a glorious new level of depth and texture to the writing and delivery.</p>
<p>Recorded back-to-back and released simultaneously, the albums work in tandem to elucidate both sides of Conor's creative output at the time. I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning is a country-tinged m√©lange of Conor's finest acoustic songs, featuring guest vocal appearances from Emmylou Harris and Jim James of My Morning Jacket, whereas Digital Ash in a Digital Urn is a more produced, band-centric album featuring cameo appearances by Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs.</p>

boniverii12,"Bon Iver I,I 12""","<p>Vinyl LP pressing. 2019 release, Bon Iver's most expansive, joyful and generous album to date. If For Emma, Forever Ago was the crisp, heart-strung isolation of a northern Winter; Bon Iver the rise and whirr of burgeoning Spring; and 22, A Million, a blistering, ""crazy energy"" Summer record, i, i completes the cycle: a fall record; Autumn-colored, ruminative, steeped. The autumn of Bon Iver is a celebration of self-acceptance and gratitude, bolstered by community and delivering the bounty of an infinite American music. The sales and accolades are well-known - multiple Gold albums, multiple Grammys, chart-topping collaborations and festival headlines. But even more significantly, with each release Bon Iver quietly shifts the state of modern music. From the boundaries of folk, to the rules of autotune, to production work for others, Bon Iver's fingerprint finds it's way across the mainstream every time. Vernon has always been a master collaborator, and on i, i that desire becomes maximal, with guests ranging from Moses Sumney and Bruce Hornsby to Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. Here, the music - and band, and themes, and creative space - are bigger than ever.</p>",Jagjaguwar Records,,"new 12""","10s, indie, spo-default, spo-disabled",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'190827901,566.9904625,shopify,deny,manual,26.00,,true,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/7539/products/c654d1c26f1a46cce4570f385baf08b29a0e7f84.jpg?v=1585622851,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,true,,,true,,,true,,,true,,,active
